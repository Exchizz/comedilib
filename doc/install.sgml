Installation and Configuration
</title>

<para>
I assume that your hardware device is in your computer, and that
you know the relevant details about it, i.e., what kind of card
it is, the I/O base, the IRQ, jumper settings related to input
ranges, etc.
</para>

<para>
To tell the comedi kernel module that you have a particular device, and
some information about it, you will be running the comedi_config
command.  Perhaps you should read the man page now.
</para>

<para>
In this tutorial, I will go through the process of configuring comedi
for two devices, a National Instruments AT-MIO-16E-10
and a Data Translation DT2821-F-8DI.
</para>

<para>
The NI board is plug-and-play, and the man page tells me that I need
to configure the PnP part of the board with isapnptools.  The isapnptools
package is a little cryptic, but the concepts are simple.  Once I
learned how to use it, I settled on a /etc/isapnp.conf file that
contained the lines:
</para>


<screen>
# ANSI string --&gt;National Instruments, AT-MIO-16E-10&lt;--
(CONFIGURE NIC2400/10725401 (LD 0
	(IO 0 (BASE 0x0260))
	(INT 0 (IRQ 3 (MODE +E)))
#	(DMA 0 (CHANNEL 5))
#	(DMA 1 (CHANNEL 6))
	(ACT Y)
))
</screen>


<para>
It also contains a few lines about overall configuration and about my
sound card.  I found out after a bit of trial-and-error that the NI
board does not always work with interrupts other than IRQ 3.  YMMV.
Currently, the driver doesn't use DMA, but it may in the future, so
I commented out the DMA lines.  It is a curious fact that the device
ignores the IRQ and DMA information given here, however, I keep the
information here to remind myself that the numbers aren't arbitrary.
</para>

<para>
When I run comedi_config (as root, of course), I provide the same
information.  Since I want to have the board configured every time
I boot, I put the line
</para>

<screen>
/usr/sbin/comedi_config /dev/comedi0 ni_atmio 0x260,3
</screen>

<para>
into <filename>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</filename>.  You can, of course, run this command at
a command prompt.  The man page tells me that the option list
is supposed to be "(I/O base),(IRQ)", so I used the same numbers
as I put in /etc/isapnp.conf, i.e., 0x260,3.
</para>

<para>
For the Data Translation board, I need to have a list of the
jumper settings.  Fortunately, I wrote them all down in the
manual -- I hope they are still correct.  However, I had to
open the case to figure out which board in the series I had.
It is a DT2821-f-8di.  The man page of comedi_config tells
me that I need to know the I/O base, IRQ, DMA 1, DMA 2.  However,
since I wrote the driver, I know that it also recognizes the
differential/single-ended and unipolar/bipolar jumpers.  As always,
the source is the final authority, and looking in module/dt282x.c
tells me that the options list is interpreted as:
</para>

<!-- XXX
<itemize>
<item>I/O base
<item>IRQ
<item>1=differential, 0=single ended
<item>ai 0=unipolar, 1=bipolar
<item>ao0 0=unipolar, 1=bipolar
<item>ao1 0=unipolar, 1=bipolar
<item>dma1
<item>dma2
</itemize>
-->

<para>
(ai=analog input, ao=analog output.)  From this, I decide that
the appropriate options list is
</para>

<screen>
0x200,4,,1,1,1
</screen>

<para>
I left the differential/single-ended number blank, since the
driver already knowns (from the board name), that it is
differential.  I  also left the DMA numbers blank, since I
don't want the driver to use DMA.  (Don't want it to interfere
with my sound card -- life is full of difficult choices.)
Keep in mind that things commented in the source, but not in
the documentation are about as likely to change as the weather,
so I put good comments next to the following line when I put
it in rc.local.
</para>

<screen>
/usr/sbin/comedi_config /dev/comedi1 dt2821-f-8di 0x200,4,,1,1,1
</screen>

<para>
So now I think that I have my boards configured correctly.
Since data acquisition boards are not typically well-engineered,
Comedi sometimes can't figure out if the board is actually there.
If it can't, it assumes you are right.  Both of these boards
are well-made, so comedi will give me an error message if it
can't find them.  The comedi kernel module, since it is a part
of the kernel, prints messages to the kernel logs, which you
can access through the command 'dmesg' or /var/log/messages.
Here is a configuration failure (from dmesg):
</para>

<screen>
comedi0: ni_atmio: 0x0200 can't find board
</screen>

<para>
When it does work, I get:
</para>

<screen>
comedi0: ni_atmio: 0x0260 at-mio-16e-10 ( irq = 3 )
</screen>

<para>
Note that it also correctly identified my board.
</para>

<title>
Getting information from comedi
</title>

<para>
So now that we have comedi talking to the hardware, we want to
talk to comedi.  Here's some pretty low-level information --
it's sometimes useful for debugging:
</para>

<screen>
cat /proc/comedi
</screen>

<para>
Right now, on my computer, this command gives:
</para>

<screen>
comedi version 0.6.4
format string
 0: ni_atmio             at-mio-16e-10           7
 1: dt282x               dt2821-f-8di            4
</screen>

<para>
This is a feature that is not well-developed yet.  Basically, it
currently tells you driver name, device name, and number of
subdevices.
</para>

<para>
In the <filename>demo/</filename> directory, there is a command called
<command>info</command>, which provides information about each
subdevice on the
board.  The output of it is rather long, since I have 7
subdevices  (4 or fewer is common for other boards.)
Here's part of the output of the NI board (which
is on <filename>/dev/comedi0</filename>.)  ('demo/info /dev/comedi0')
</para>

<screen>
overall info:
  version code: 0x000604
  driver name: ni_atmio
  board name: at-mio-16e-10
  number of subdevices: 7
subdevice 0:
  type: 1 (unknown)
  number of channels: 16
  max data value: 4095
...
</screen>

<para>
The overall info gives information about the device -- basically
the same information as /proc/comedi.
</para>

<para>
This board has 7 subdevices.  Devices are separated into
subdevices that each have a distinct purpose -- e.g., analog
input, analog output, digital input/output.  This board also
has an EEPROM and calibration DACs that are also subdevices.
</para>

<para>
Subdevice 0 is the analog input subdevice.  You would have
known this from the 'type: 1 (unknown)' line, if I've updated
demo/info recently, because it would say 'type: 1 (analog input)'
instead.  The other lines should be self-explanitory.  Comedi
has more information about the device, but demo/info doesn't
currently display this.
</para>

    Writing &comedi; programs
  </title>
  <para>
    This section describes how &comedi;
    can be used in an application, to communicate data with a set
    of &comedi; devices.
    <xref linkend="acquisitionfunctions"/> gives more details about
    the various acquisition functions with which the application
    programmer can perform data acquisition in &comedi;.
  </para>
  <para>
    Also don't forget to take a good look at the
    <filename class="directory">demo</filename>
    directory of the Comedilib source code. It contains lots of examples
    for the basic functionalities of &comedi;.

      Your first &comedi; program

    <para>
      This example requires a card that has analog or digital input. This
      progam opens the device, gets the data, and prints it out:
      <programlisting>
	<xi:include href="../demo/tut1.c" parse="text"/>
      </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      The source code file for the above program can be found in Comedilib,
      at <filename>demo/tut1.c</filename>.  You can compile the program using
    </para>
    
    <screen>
      cc tut1.c -lcomedi -o tut1
    </screen>
    <para>
      The
      <function>
	<link linkend="func-ref-comedi-open">comedi_open</link>
      </function> call can only be successful if the
      <filename>comedi0</filename> device file is configured with a
      valid &comedi; driver. <xref linkend="cardconfiguration"/> explains
      how this driver is linked to the <quote>device file</quote>.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <parameter class="function">range</parameter> variable tells
      &comedi; which gain to use when measuring an analog voltage.  Since we
      don't know (yet) which numbers are valid, or what each means, we'll
      use <literal>0</literal>, because it won't cause errors.  Likewise
      with <parameter class="function">aref</parameter>, which determines the
      analog reference used.

      Converting between integer data and physical units
    </title>
    
    <para>
      If you selected an analog input subdevice, you probably noticed
      that the output of <command>tut1</command> is an unsigned
      number, for example between <literal>0</literal>
      and <literal>65535</literal> for a 16 bit analog input. &comedi;
      samples are unsigned, with <literal>0</literal> representing the
      lowest voltage of the ADC, and a hardware-dependent maximum
      value representing the highest voltage.  &comedi; compensates
      for anything else the manual for your device says (for example,
      many boards represent bipolar analog input voltages as signed
      integers).  However, you probably prefer to have this number
      translated to a voltage.  Naturally, as a good programmer, your
      first question is: <quote>How do I do this in a
      device-independent manner?</quote>
    </para>
    
    <para>
      The functions
      <link linkend="func-ref-comedi-to-physical"><function>comedi_to_physical</function></link>, <link linkend="func-ref-comedi-to-phys"><function>comedi_to_phys</function></link>,

      are used to convert between &comedi;'s integer data and floating point numbers corresponding
      to physical values (voltages, etc.).

      Actually, this is the first &comedi; program again, except
      we've added code to convert the integer data value to physical units.

      The source code file for the above program can be found in

      at /usr/share/doc/libcomedi-dev/demo/ with all the other tutorial/demo

      Asynchronous acquisition
    </title>
    <para>
      Of special importance is the so called
      "asynchronous data acquisition" where &comedi; is sampling
      in the background at a given sample rate. The
      user can retrieve the data whenever it is convenient.
      &comedi; stores the data in a ring-buffer so that
      programs can perform other tasks in the foreground, for example
      plotting data or interacting with the user. 
      This technique is used in programs such
      as <command>ktimetrace</command> or <command>comedirecord</command>.
    </para>
    <para>
      The program <command>tut3.c</command> demonstrates the
      asynchronous acquisition. The general strategy is always
      the same: first, we tell &comedi; all sampling parameters such as
      the sampling rate,
      the number of channels and anything it needs to know
      so that it can run independently in the background.
      Then &comedi; checks our request and it might
      modify it. For example we might want to have a sampling rate of
      16kHz but we only get 1kHz. Finally we can start
      the asynchronous acquisition. Once it has been started we
      need to check periodically if data is available and
      request it from &comedi; so that its internal buffer
      won't overrun.
    </para>
    <para>
      In summary the asynchonous acquisition is performed in the following
      way:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>		  
      <listitem>
	Create a command structure of type <link linkend="ref-type-comedi-cmd">comedi_cmd</link>
      </listitem>  
      <listitem>
	Call the
	function <link linkend="func-ref-comedi-get-cmd-generic-timed"><function>comedi_get_cmd_generic_timed</function></link>
	to fill the command structure with your comedi device,
	subdevice, sampling rate and number of channels.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	Create a channel-list and store it in the command structure. This
	tells comedi which channels should be sampled in the background.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	Call <link linkend="func-ref-comedi-command-test"><function>comedi_command_test</function></link> with your command structure. Comedi might modify your requested sampling rate and channels.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	Call <link linkend="func-ref-comedi-command-test"><function>comedi_command_test</function></link> again which now should return zero for success.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	Call <link linkend="func-ref-comedi-command"><function>comedi_command</function></link> to start the asynchronous acquisition. From now on the kernel ringbuffer will be filled at the specified sampling rate.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	Call periodically the standard
	function <function>read</function> and receive the data. The
	result should always be non zero as long as the acquisition
	is running.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	Convert the received data either into <link linkend="ref-type-lsampl-t">lsampl_t</link> or <link linkend="ref-type-sampl-t">sampl_t</link> depending on the subdevice flag SDF_LSAMPL.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	Poll for data with <function>read</function> as long as it returns
	a positive result or until the program terminates.
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    
    <para>
      The program below is a stripped down version of the
      program <command>cmd.c</command> in the demo directory. To
      compile it run:
    </para>
    <screen>
      gcc tut3.c -lcomedi -lm -o tut3
    </screen>
    <para>
      It requests data from two channels at 
      a sampling rate of 1kHz and a total of 10000 samples.
      which are then printed to stdout. You can pipe the data
      into a file and plot it with gnuplot. As mentioned above, central in this
      program is the loop using the standard C <function>read</function> command
      which receives the buffer contents. Below is an
      extract from <filename>tut3.c</filename> showing the
      relevant commands:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      <xi:include href="../demo/tut3_part.c" parse="text"/>
    </programlisting>
    <para>
      For advanced programmers the
      function <link linkend="func-ref-comedi-comedi-get-buffer-contents"><function>comedi_get_buffer_contents</function></link>
      is useful to check if there is actually data in the ringbuffer
      so that a call of <function>read</function> can be avoided for example
      when the data readout is called by a timer call-back function.

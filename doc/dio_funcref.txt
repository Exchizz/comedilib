Function: comedi_dio_bitfield2 -- read/write multiple digital channels
Retval: int
Param: comedi_t * device
Param: unsigned int subdevice
Param: unsigned int write_mask
Param: unsigned int * bits
Param: unsigned int base_channel
Description:
 The function comedi_dio_bitfield2() allows multiple channels to
 be read or written together on a digital input, output,
 or configurable digital I/O device.
 The parameter <parameter>write_mask</parameter>
 and the value pointed to by <parameter>bits</parameter>
 are interpreted as bit fields, with the least significant bit
 representing channel <parameter>base_channel</parameter>.
 For each bit in <parameter>write_mask</parameter> that is
 set to 1, the cooresponding bit in <parameter>*bits</parameter>
 is written to the digital
 output channel.  After writing all the output channels, each
 channel is read, and the result placed in the approprate bits in
 <parameter>*bits</parameter>.  The result of
 reading an output channel is the last
 value written to the output channel.

 All the channels may not be read or written at the exact same time.
 For example, the driver may need to sequentially write to
 several ports in order to set all the digital channels specified
 by the <parameter>write_mask</parameter>.

Function: comedi_dio_config -- change input/output properties of channel
Retval: int
Param: comedi_t * device
Param: unsigned int subdevice
Param: unsigned int channel
Param: unsigned int direction
Description:
 The function comedi_dio_config() configures individual channels
 in a digital I/O subdevice to be either input or output, depending
 on the value of parameter direction.  Valid directions are
 COMEDI_INPUT or COMEDI_OUTPUT.

 Depending on the capabilities of the hardware device, multiple
 channels may be grouped together to determine direction.  In this
 case, a single call to comedi_dio_config() for any channel in the
 group will affect the entire group.

 If sucessful, 1 is returned, otherwise -1.

Function: comedi_dio_get_config -- query input/output properties of channel
Retval: int
Param: comedi_t * device
Param: unsigned int subdevice
Param: unsigned int channel
Param: unsigned int * direction
Description:
 The function comedi_dio_get_config() querys the configuration of
 an individual channel
 in a digital I/O subdevice (see comedi_dio_config()).
 On success, the variable specified by the "direction" pointer will
 be set to either COMEDI_INPUT or COMEDI_OUTPUT.

 If sucessful, 0 is returned, otherwise -1.

Function: comedi_dio_read -- read single bit from digital channel
Retval: int
Param: comedi_t * device
Param: unsigned int subdevice
Param: unsigned int channel
Param: unsigned int * bit
Description:
 The function reads the channel channel belonging to the
 subdevice subdevice of device device.  The data value that is
 read is stored in the location pointed to by bit.  This function
 is equivalent to comedi_data_read(device,subdevice,channel,0,0,bit).
 This function does not require a digital subdevice or a subdevice
 with a maximum data value of 1 to work properly.

 Return values and errors are the same as comedi_data_read().

Function: comedi_dio_write -- write single bit to digital channel
Retval: int
Param: comedi_t * device
Param: unsigned int subdevice
Param: unsigned int channel
Param: unsigned int bit
Description:
 The function writes the value bit to the channel channel belonging
 to the subdevice subdevice of device device.  This function
 is equivalent to comedi_data_write(device,subdevice,channel,0,0,bit).
 This function does not require a digital subdevice or a subdevice
 with a maximum data value of 1 to work properly.

 Return values and errors are the same as comedi_data_write().

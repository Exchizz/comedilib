Compile using 'make'.  If this doesn't work, make sure you have the
basic tools installed to compile.  If you can successfully compile
other things, consult the author, as he has probably made a mistake.

Install using 'make install' as root.  This installs the files:
	/usr/lib/libcomedi.so.0.3
	/usr/include/comedi.h
	/usr/include/comedilib.h
	and other things...

If you run Debian GNU/Linux, comedilib is packaged as the packages
libcomedi0 and libcomedi-dev.  These are available as part of woody.

To write programs that use comedi, look at examples in the demo/ and
the documentation in the doc/ directory.

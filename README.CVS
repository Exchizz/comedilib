Building Comedilib from CVS is slightly different from the releases.
There is an additional step of creating the configure script and
makefiles from the templates using automake, autoconf, etc.  This
is all done automatically by running the program autoreconf
witch should be part of your distribution's autoconf package.

Requirements:

  automake >= 1.6
  autoconf >= 2.54
  libtool >= 1.5

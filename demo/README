Examples


ao_waveform:
	You need a device (and driver) capable of streaming analog output,
	which currently is some of the members of the NI AT-MIO and PCI-MIO
	E series.  Creates a sine wave on an analog output channel.

cmd:
	Asynchronous input.

eeprom_dump:
	Dumps the EEPROM of a card, if it has one.  Useful for debugging
	devices/drivers.

info:
	Displays some information that Comedi knows about a device.

inp:
	Simple input demo.  Reads one sample from an input line.

inpn:
	Slightly more complicated input demo.  (It has a for() loop.)
	Reads each channel on a subdevice, at every possible input
	range, and converts the data to a voltage.

insn:
	Example showing how to use instructions directly.

sv:
	Similar to inp, but measures the input using the comedi_sv_*()
	functions, which average many samples to try to get a more accurate
	estimate of the actual input.

tut1:
tut2:
	Tutorial examples.


Many of these demos are linked with the file main.c, which parses
command line options.  Some options don't make sense with all programs.
The options are:


-a <aref>	uses analog reference <aref> (default: 0)
-c <chan>	uses channel <chan>
-s <subd>	uses subdevice <subd>
-r <range>	uses voltage range <range>
-f <file>	uses device file <file> (default: /dev/comedi0)
-v		verbose
-d		set analog reference to differential
-g		set analog reference to ground
-o		set analog reference to other
-m		set analog reference to common

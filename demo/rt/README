I'm using Linux-2.0.36/RTLinux 9J


it.o toggles a digital output bit, like the rectangle demo
in the RTLinux source

ai.o does a timed acquisition on an analog input subdevice,
utilizing a callback function to copy the analog input value
to the analog output channel, in effect, creating a "follower".

Both demos are configured for an NI AT-MIO E series board.
To use another driver/board, the source will need to be edited.
